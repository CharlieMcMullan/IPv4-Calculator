# IPv4-Calculator
I created this calculator using Java. A user will input the IPv4 address and Subnet Mask. The program outputs the binary values of these addresses. Calculates the number of usable hosts, the reserved host, broadcast, and network address as well as their binary values. This script was not made for public use and only to develop my skills.
